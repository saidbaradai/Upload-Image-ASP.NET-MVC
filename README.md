# Upload-Image-ASP.NET-MVC

This small site is about how to stor an object in the database using Entity Framework (the object have an id,title and image file properties).

so i stored the actual photos in my diractory system in "Images" diractor, and stored thier path in the database.

I also added the date as a string to the images names to avoid the troubles that comes when the user try to add an image that it's name has already been used.
